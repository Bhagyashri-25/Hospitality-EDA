## 🎯 Objective

* Analyze aggregate bookings and property performance
* Identify occupancy patterns across room categories and cities
* Examine revenue and customer ratings
* Derive actionable insights for business decisions

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:** Pandas 📊, Matplotlib 📈, Seaborn 🎨
* **IDE:** VS Code 💻 / Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔍 Data Exploration & Cleaning

* Imported and explored the dataset to understand structure and quality
* Checked for null values and filled them using mean or median
* Filtered records where successful bookings exceeded capacity
* Performed data transformation for aggregations and analysis

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

* Explored aggregate bookings and unique property IDs
* Calculated total bookings per property
* Identified days with bookings exceeding capacity
* Found properties with highest capacity 🏢
* Calculated average occupancy rate per room category and per city 🛏
* Compared weekday vs weekend occupancy 🗓
* Analyzed occupancy for June and appended August data 📅
* Calculated revenue per city 💰 and per hotel type 🏨
* Calculated average rating per city ⭐

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Average occupancy and revenue patterns per city and property
* Weekday vs weekend occupancy trends
* Room categories with highest occupancy
* Top-performing cities in terms of revenue and customer ratings
